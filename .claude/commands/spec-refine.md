# Refine BUsiness Specification

1. Read the business specification file `/specs/business-specs.md`

2. Edit and refine the document in place:
   - Fix grammar/spelling
   - Clarify ambiguous sections
   - Make technical choices concrete and actionable
   - Integrate FAQ answers into main sections where they add clarity
   - Add FAQ items for remaining unclear points (max 10 total)
   - Improve structure/flow if needed

3. Show key changes and ask user to review

Focus: Make spec clear enough for implementation without ambiguity.
