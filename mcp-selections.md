## Advice

Enable MCP only when it's necessary.

## [Serena MCP for Claude Code](https://github.com/oraios/serena)

Semantic code retrieval and intelligent code editing => Will boost your Claude using less token, and going faster.

My Serena Setup to do on each new project (See the doc for yours)

```
claude mcp add serena -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --project "$(pwd)"
```

INFO: I had some trouble to make it work. I had to start it manually before for Claude to make it works. But now it's up and running it's great.
